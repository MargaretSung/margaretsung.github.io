		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>1.<a href="squarespace.com"target="_blank">squarespace.com</a><br>2.<a href="jolenelin.com"target="_blank">jolinelin.com</a></p>
		
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Both sites use a ton of visual imagery and symmetry. The copy is simple and straightforward for the reader. The negative space frames the focal points and creates a call to action to choose a template or click on a photo. The copy is minimal which enhances the visual imagery.</p>
		
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>They both use negative space to frame their focal points and they both use strong imagery to tell a story.  Both are artistic and have minimal copy.  The contrast is demonstrated through the visual cues and call to action. Squarespace is an interactive site where a user explores and envisions how they might use a template personally. Jolene Lin uses her artistry to create eyecandy and allows the user to explore freely without the goal of searching for a personal outcome.</p>
